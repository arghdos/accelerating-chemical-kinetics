\frametitle{Chemical Kinetic Simulations are \textbf{Critical}}
In order to meet increasingly stringent emissions and efficiency requirements, designers of combustion devices have turned to \textbf{new technologies} and \textbf{new fuels}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Novel combustion regimes such as low-temperature combustion are often controlled by chemical processes, rather than directly controllable physical processes as in current technology
 \item Further, developed solutions must be flexible to accommodate a variety of next generation fuels
\end{itemize}
Computationally guided combustion design has played an important role in development of these new technologies, however use of realistic chemical modeling (as required for predictive reacting-flow simulations) is prohibitively expensive for most practical systems.

 \frametitle{Chemical Kinetic Integration is \textbf{Expensive}}
 The size of chemical kinetic models for fuels relevant transportation and energy generation may consist of hundreds to thousands of chemical species, with potentially tens of thousands of reactions
 \begin{itemize}
  \item e.g., for gasoline \footfullcite{Mehl:2011cn} and jet fuel\footfullcite{Naik2011434}
 \end{itemize}
 Commonly used implicit integration integration techniques scales poorly with increasing model size.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item These methods require repeated evaluation and factorization of the chemical kinetic Jacobian.
  \item Naive implementations of these operations scale \textbf{quadratically} and \textbf{cubically} with the number of species in a model, respectively\footfullcite{Lu:2009gh}.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Strategies for cost reduction}
 A few major strategies exist to accelerate chemical kinetic integration:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Model reduction, a host of techniques to reduce the size of the system being solved while maintaining accurate chemical kinetics (as compared to the full model)
  \item Improved integration techniques, development of new integration algorithms specifically for chemical kinetics, e.g. hybrid implicit\slash explicit integrators, tabulation techniques, analytical Jacobian codes, and on-the-fly stiffness removal
  \item \textbf{Solver vectorization}, reformulation of solvers for efficient single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) execution both on specialized hardware---e.g. graphics processing units (GPUs)---and modern central processing units (CPUs)
  \item \textbf{High performance computing techniques}, stiffness-based load balancing, scaling for high performance clusters
 \end{itemize}
 We will focus on vectorization and high performance computing.

 \begin{columns}
 
 \begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
  \textbf{Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)} processing is a \textit{vector processing} paradigm that allows processing elements to execute the same instruction concurrently on different data.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item SIMD-enabled processors include Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Co-processors (e.g. Intel's Xeon Phi), and modern central processing units (CPUs).

    \item When used in the context of multiple CPU threads, this is referred to as \textbf{Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT)} processing.
